## Notes

- There are 45 total participants.
  - 15 healthy
  - 16 pre-diabetics
  - 14 type II diabetics
- In the data, the numbering of the participants skips over 24, 25, 37, and 40
  - So the numbering goes from 1 to 49 but covers all 45 participants
- In each participant's sheet, there are columns for meal types and macros, but they are empty.
